*DONE* void function greet(int size, bool duplicates)
{
    1) Program will great the user 

    2) Ask the user if they would allow duplicates in the array 

    3) Ask the user how long they could choose from 4, 6, 8

    pass by reference the value so no return 
}

void generatedArr(int len)
{
    - create and array that will have the same length of the one that takes in user input 
    - Will need a random num generator to help fill in the array 

}

void compareArr()
{
    - this function will compare the user input array with the other array from the random generatedArr 
}

display arr filled with x's 
    have a counter variable that lets the user know how many tries they have left guessing 
    Also displa the coutner variable so that the user knows how many tries they have left 


 



Functionality of the array and how it should be used 
- Uses a char array to swap the data 
- the array is filled with x's then swapped with the input from user 
    - if that user input is correct it there is a variable that lets the user know if it is "1-4" 
- The program needs two arays because it then I compare the correct array with the input array 


To-do LATER
- Format with the iomanip library to make program look nice and pretty 


Questions? 
- How to get the user input from c++ in a single line but multiple inputs?
    - or should i get the user input for each element of the array?
