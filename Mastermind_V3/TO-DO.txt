This program will use an AI that I will create and will guess from 0000 and incremeant
by 1111 and search each element to see if the code matches at that certain element if not
continue to 2222 

so it should look like this 

guess: 0000 Code: 0120 -> from this line it should find the first and last element to be 0 
guess: 1111 Code: 0120 -> from this line it should find second element to be 1 
guess: 2222 Code: 0120 -> from this line it should find third element to be 2 



*DONE* string AI(int len) // The main purpose of this function is to create a guess created by the AI 
{
    create a string that starts at 0000 

    need to fill the array with the new counter number which will start at 0 

    the function needs to just create a guess  ex: 0000 
                                               ex: 1111
                                               ex: 2222
                                               ex: 3333
    return guess; 
}

*DONE* void breakCode(string AIguess, string code) //AIguess is from the AI function and code is from the generated code 
{
    this function will get the AI guess and compare the values with the code 

    whenever the function detects the that the AIguess is in the right spot then it will add that element to another array which will slowly have the correct code 
}

*NEED TO DO* 
- work on the displaying the AI guess and the amount wrong and right and how many guess it took at the end 
- Print out the code with the AI guess then the breakCode 
 EXAMPLE: 
 CODE       AI guess        BreakCode 
 0120       0000            0000
 0120       1111            0100
 0120       2222            0120
