This program will use an AI that I will create and will guess from 0000 and incremeant
by 1111 and search each element to see if the code matches at that certain element if not
continue to 2222 

so it should look like this 

guess: 0000 Code: 0120 -> from this line it should find the first and last element to be 0 
guess: 1111 Code: 0120 -> from this line it should find second element to be 1 
guess: 2222 Code: 0120 -> from this line it should find third element to be 2
